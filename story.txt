     My name is Aladdin Junior. Earlier today, as I was walking down the street I saw a lamp that looked liked a dirty and out of place antique.
As I rubbed the lamp to wipe the dirt off, a supernatural being that claims to be a genie appeared and offered to grant me three wishes. I thought
it was a prank and wished for 100 more wishes, but the genie told me I can only wish for something that can be materialized.

    I searched my brain for any possible material thing I could want. I had dreams of becoming the master of all guitarists or th envy of every party. The genie floated patiently and stared me down, only asking "Well, what'll it be?". This was the hardest decision of my life, I have the opportunity to get anything in the world! "I've got it. A double decker couch with extra cup holders."
