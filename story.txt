     My name is Aladdin Junior. Earlier today, as I was walking down the street I saw a lamp that looked liked a dirty and out of place antique.
As I rubbed the lamp to wipe the dirt off, a supernatural being that claims to be a genie appeared and offered to grant me three wishes. I thought
it was a prank and wished for 100 more wishes, but the genie told me I can only wish for something that can be materialized.
