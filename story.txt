     My name is Aladdin Junior. Earlier today, as I was walking down the street I saw a lamp that looked liked a dirty and out of place antique.
As I rubbed the lamp to wipe the dirt off, a supernatural being that claims to be a genie appeared and offered to grant me three wishes. I thought
it was a prank and wished for 100 more wishes, but the genie told me I can only wish for something that can be materialized.

    I searched my brain for any possible material thing I could want. I had dreams of becoming the master of all guitarists or th envy of every party. The genie floated patiently and stared me down, only asking "Well, what'll it be?". This was the hardest decision of my life, I have the opportunity to get anything in the world! "I've got it. A double decker couch with extra cup holders."

    Now for my second wish, I had a decision to make.  I could either continue to think of myself, or I could assist others. Now I like to think myself charitable, but I was the one to rub the lamp, not the people of the city.  I came to a compromise, "Genie, for my second wish, I wish for my double decker coch with extra cup holders to be placed in a double decker bus so I can ride around and enjoy the couch with anyone in the city."

   I had my double decker couch and my double decker bus which only left me with one more wish. I thought for while before I posed a question to the genie. "So are there any other rules besides the wish must have tangibility?" I asked. "Yes, the rules are the wish must be tangible, it cannot impose on free will, and you cannot wish for something intended to harm others." With that I figured it out. "Alright genie I have my last wish, but one more question, could I wish for more than one quantity? Say two couches instead of one?" The genie replied "Yes that is acceptable within reason." With that I made my final wish "Then I wish for three more magic lamps Mr. Genie."
